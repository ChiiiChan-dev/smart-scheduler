# smart-scheduler

This is a mini system program called Smart Scheduler. It helps time management and subject organization for exam schedules â€” you can: 
- Add exam details (like subject, time, date, and room) 
- View all scheduled exams 
- Change or correct any exam details 
- Remove an exam from the schedule

1. The first option which is adding exam allows the user to create a new entry schedule.
This function allows the user to store the entry schedule (name, time, date, assigned room). 
2. The second option is schedule viewing.
This allows the user to separately view all of the entry schedule that has been saved. 
3. The third option is a function that updates/edits the entry schedule that has been already stored.
The user just have to type the entry name and this will grant access to update the time, date, and assigned room. 
4. The fourth one is the function that removes/delete an entry schedule from the stored entry.
 The user also have to type the entry name to be removed in order to complete the action.


The whole system program has been developed by the following members: 
- James Morano 
- Alvin Macalinao 
- Whins Andre Origenes 
- Christian Espiritu
